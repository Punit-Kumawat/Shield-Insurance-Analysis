## Project Overview:
Shield Insurance is committed to providing affordable and accessible insurance policies for individuals across all age groups. The company operates in five major cities — Mumbai, Chennai, Delhi NCR, Hyderabad, and Indore — and distributes its policies through various channels including offline agents, direct sales, a mobile application, and a dedicated website. Currently, Shield Insurance offers a diverse portfolio of nine policy types.

As part of this project, my objective was to support the company in making informed, data-driven decisions by analyzing their operational data from November 2022 to April 2023.

### 📁 Data Sets Used:
For this project, I worked with a Star Schema data model consisting of 3 Dimension Tables and 2 Fact Tables:

### 🔹 Dimension Tables:
Dim_Customer – Contains customer information

Dim_Date – Includes date-related details 

Dim_Policies – Information about policy types and categories

### 🔸 Fact Tables:
Fact_Premiums – Records of premium payments made by customers

Fact_Settlements – Details of insurance claims and settlements

## Dashboard Overview - 

I created a dashboard with three key sections:

**Home Page -** When a user logs in for the first time, they will land on this page. From here, they can navigate to different pages.
